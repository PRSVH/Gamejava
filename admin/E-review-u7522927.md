### Comments 

1. This code is well documented and easy to understand.
2. I think so many if statements may be redundant. Switch case would be preferable.
3. All variables are well-named and easy to understand.
4. Overall the code is well-written.However I think some more comments could be used in the if statements to explain what is going on.
