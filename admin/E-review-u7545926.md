Component: <CatanDice.canDoSequence>

### Comments

1. The best feature of this code is that the logic of this code is very clear and readable.
2. It seems some code is not very well documented, but I think this is fine because the logic is very clear. With some explanation, these codes will be much easier for others to understand.
3. I think the program decomposition is very appropriate. For example, my group mate also implement other three methods(subtractElementwise(int[] a, int[] b), addElementwise(int[] first, int[] second) and findIndex(String arr[], String t)) to implement canDoSequence.
4. I think methods and variables are properly named.
5. I think codes can still be improved. For example, my group mate use three separate if to identify "build", "trade" and "swap" actions, but I think else-if will be more efficient.
